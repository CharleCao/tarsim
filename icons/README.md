This folder should be located as: /path/to/tarsim/icons
So for example, if Tarsim is instnatiated in another executive like users_app, 
then icons should be located at /path/to/users_app/icons. You can replace
these icons with what you'd like. Just please make sure the icon is in PNG
format with minimum resolution of 300dpi and minumum size of 200x200. Anything 
less than that may result in low quality and more than that may slow down your
system. But you can always try.
